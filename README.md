- 👋 Hi, I’m @intransition, Physicst and Data Scientist
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Machine Learning and their pipelines, Symbolic Regression (GP, Genetic Programming) but also Information Theory and 
         its implications therein.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Dynamical Systems and their practical aspects on Time Series (Ah, you mean technically? see how to use this Git packages, it seems quite handy...)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science projects and R&D but I wear also the BA hat so you may ask me about Customere Needs gathering
- 📫 How to reach me : carlofan@mail.com
