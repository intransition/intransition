- 👋 Hi, I’m @intransition, Physicst and Data Scientist (well, the transiton occurred during 2014, I am done by now - probably w'd better say 'evolved')
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Machine Learning and their pipelines, Symbolic Regression (GP, Genetic Programming) but also Information Theory and 
         its implications therein.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Dynamical Systems and their practical aspects on Time Series (Technically? How to use this 'Git packages', it seems quite handy...)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science projects and R&D but I also do wear the 'BA hat'. So ask me about Customer needs gathering and 'Business Understanding (yes, THE good old CRISP-DM).
- 📫 How to reach me? carlofan@mail.com
